Welcome to my 'blog'. Well, this isn't really an actual blog. Its a set of notes that
I would like to keep for future reference.

Obviously all of the stuff that I write down does not guarantee anything and I'm not the
leading expert in most of the fields I write about.

Here is the current list of articles:
- [Git commands for beginners](?page=git-commands)
- [Using jetty runner to serve client & proxy](?page=jetty-client-proxy)
- [Node Connect api + client](?page=node-client-api)
- [Java getters & setters test](?page=getters-setters-test)
- [JQuery JSON data loader](?page=json-data-loader)
- [Javascript exercises](?page=javascript-exercises)

I have created this site. It is built around markdown pages which are parsed to HTML
using [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). Nothing fancy is going on,
just some custom CSS and a small javascript that lets me include markdown pages.
