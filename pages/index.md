Welcome to my 'blog'. Well, this isn't really an actual blog. Its a set of notes that

I have created this site. It is built around markdown pages which are parsed to HTML
using [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown). Nothing fancy is going on,
just some custom CSS and a small javascript that lets me include markdown pages.
